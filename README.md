# Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationships between features in the **Iris dataset**, focusing on the correlation between **Petal Length and Petal Width** across different species (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**). The visualization helps in understanding how these features contribute to species classification.

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of **150 samples** with **four features**:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**
- **Species** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Key Findings
- **Petal Length vs. Petal Width** shows a **strong positive correlation**.
- **Setosa** is clearly separable, while **Versicolor and Virginica overlap**.
- Petal features are more effective for classification than sepal features.

## Visualization
A **scatter plot** is used to visualize the relationship between **Petal Length and Petal Width**, with color-coded species:
- **Setosa** â†’ ðŸŸ¥ Red
- **Versicolor** â†’ ðŸŸ£ Purple
- **Virginica** â†’ ðŸ”µ Blue



## Installation & Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```sh
pip install seaborn matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Run the provided Python script.
2. The scatter plot will display the relationship between **Petal Length and Petal Width** for different species.
3. Analyze the clustering pattern to understand how well species are separated.

## Conclusion
The Iris dataset is a great example of how **simple feature analysis** can lead to effective classification. **Petal Length and Petal Width** are strong predictors for species identification.
